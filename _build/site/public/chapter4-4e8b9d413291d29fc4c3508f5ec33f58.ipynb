    "We have a new challenge. Suppose you are selling **Cloud Storage** on a server.\n",
    "* **Total Capacity:** 100 GB ($W$)\n",
    "* **Bidders:** $n$ companies. Each wants a specific amount of space ($w_i$) and has a private value ($v_i$) for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the famous **Knapsack Problem**. We want to fit the most valuable combination of files into the limited space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Impossible Triangle (The Trilemma)\n",
    "We want an auction that is:\n",
    "1.  **DSIC (Truthful):** People tell the truth about their value.\n",
    "2.  **Optimal:** We get the absolute maximum total value possible.\n",
    "3.  **Polynomial Time (Fast):** It runs quickly, even with thousands of bidders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad News:** We can't have all three. The Knapsack Problem is **NP-Hard**. Solving it perfectly takes too long (exponential time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Approximation\n",
    "Since we can't be *perfect* and *fast*, we compromise. We design an algorithm that is **fast** and **\"pretty good\"** (Approximate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Greedy Heuristic:**\n",
    "Instead of checking every combination, we look at the **\"Bang for the Buck\"** (Value per GB).\n",
    "1.  Calculate density $d_i = \\frac{v_i}{w_i}$ for everyone.\n",
    "2.  Sort bidders from highest density to lowest.\n",
    "3.  Let them in one by one until the server is full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this work? Let's race the \"Perfect\" algorithm against the \"Greedy\" one."
