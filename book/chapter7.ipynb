    "# Chapter 7: The VCG Mechanism - You Pay What You Cost Others\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, bidders wanted one thing (a single number).\n",
    "In this chapter, we look at **Combinatorial Auctions**.\n",
    "* **The Setup:** We are selling multiple items (e.g., License A and License B).\n",
    "* **The Problem:** Bidders have complex preferences.\n",
    "    * Alice might pay \\$10 for A, \\$10 for B, but **\\$100 for A and B together** (Synergy).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we sell these items to maximize social welfare? And what do we charge to ensure truthfulness?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: The VCG Mechanism (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves)\n",
    "The VCG mechanism is a generalization of the Second-Price auction. It works for *any* outcome structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rules\n",
    "1.  **Allocation:** Choose the outcome that maximizes **Total Welfare** (Total Happiness).\n",
    "2.  **Payment:** Each winner pays their **\"Social Cost\"** (or Externality).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is \"Social Cost\"?\n",
    "This is the brilliant insight of VCG. You pay exactly the amount of \"harm\" you cause to the other bidders by taking the items you won.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Payment}_i = (\\text{Welfare of Others if } i \\text{ didn't exist}) - (\\text{Welfare of Others when } i \\text{ is present})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your presence doesn't hurt anyone (e.g., you take an apple nobody else wanted), you pay **\\$0**.\n",
    "* If you take an item that prevented Bob from getting \\$50 of value, you pay **\\$50**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this in action with a **Spectrum Auction**."

    "1.  **Winner:** Bidder 2 (The National Giant) wins **both** items.\n",
    "    * This is correct because their value (\\$250) is higher than Bidder 0 + Bidder 1 combined (\\$100 + \\$100 = \\$200).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  **The Payment:** Bidder 2 pays **\\$200**.\n",
    "    * **Why?** If Bidder 2 wasn't there, Bidder 0 would have won North (\\$100) and Bidder 1 would have won South (\\$100). Total Welfare = \\$200.\n",
    "    * By showing up and winning, Bidder 2 \"destroyed\" \\$200 worth of value for the others.\n",
    "    * Therefore, Bidder 2 pays exactly the damage they caused: \\$200.\n",
    "    * Bidder 2 walks away with a profit of **\\$50** (\\$250 value - \\$200 price).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Catch:**\n",
    "While VCG is theoretically perfect (Dominant Strategy Truthful), it has downsides:\n",
    "* **Low Revenue:** Sometimes the seller makes \\$0 even if the items are valuable.\n",
    "* **Collusion:** Losing bidders can team up to trick the system.\n",
    "* **Complexity:** As you saw in the code, we had to check every combination. For 100 items, this is impossible for a computer to solve!"
