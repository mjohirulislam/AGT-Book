    "# Chapter 10: Stable Matching - The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We are often faced with the problem of pairing two sets of agents together:\n",
    "* **Kidney Exchange:** Donors $\\leftrightarrow$ Patients.\n",
    "* **Medical Residency:** Doctors $\\leftrightarrow$ Hospitals.\n",
    "* **Dating:** Men $\\leftrightarrow$ Women (The classic \"Stable Marriage\" problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal: Stability\n",
    "A matching is **Stable** if there are no **Blocking Pairs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Blocking Pair?\n",
    "Imagine Alice is married to Bob, and Charlie is married to Diane.\n",
    "* If Alice likes Charlie *more* than Bob...\n",
    "* AND Charlie likes Alice *more* than Diane...\n",
    "* ...then Alice and Charlie will leave their partners and run off together. **The system is unstable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Gale-Shapley (Deferred Acceptance)\n",
    "In 1962, Gale and Shapley proved that a stable matching **always exists** and can be found using a simple algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Propose:** Each \"Man\" proposes to his favorite \"Woman\" who hasn't rejected him yet.\n",
    "2.  **Defer:** Each \"Woman\" looks at her offers. She holds onto the **best one** (for now) and rejects the others. She does *not* say \"yes\" yet; she just says \"maybe.\"\n",
    "3.  **Repeat:** Rejected men propose to their *next* favorite choice.\n",
    "4.  **End:** When offers stop changing, the \"maybes\" become \"yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this algorithm to pair up Medical Residents with Hospitals."
