    "# Chapter 10: Stable Matching - The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We are often faced with the problem of pairing two sets of agents together:\n",
    "* **Kidney Exchange:** Donors $\\leftrightarrow$ Patients.\n",
    "* **Medical Residency:** Doctors $\\leftrightarrow$ Hospitals.\n",
    "* **Dating:** Men $\\leftrightarrow$ Women (The classic \"Stable Marriage\" problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal: Stability\n",
    "A matching is **Stable** if there are no **Blocking Pairs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Blocking Pair?\n",
    "Imagine Alice is married to Bob, and Charlie is married to Diane.\n",
    "* If Alice likes Charlie *more* than Bob...\n",
    "* AND Charlie likes Alice *more* than Diane...\n",
    "* ...then Alice and Charlie will leave their partners and run off together. **The system is unstable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Gale-Shapley (Deferred Acceptance)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1962, Gale and Shapley proved that a stable matching **always exists** and can be found using a simple algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are about to simulate the famous **National Resident Matching Program (NRMP)**, let's describe the algorithm using **Doctors (Residents)** and **Hospitals**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Apply (Propose):** Each **Resident** applies to their favorite **Hospital** that hasn't rejected them yet.\n",
    "2.  **Defer (Tentative Match):** Each **Hospital** looks at all the applications they received (plus the one they were already holding).\n",
    "    * They hold onto the **best applicant** (based on the hospital's rankings).\n",
    "    * They **reject** everyone else.\n",
    "    * *Crucial Point:* The hospital does not say \"Final Yes\" yet. They only say \"You are my best option *so far*.\"\n",
    "3.  **Repeat:** Any Resident who got rejected crosses that hospital off their list and applies to their **next favorite** choice.\n",
    "4.  **End:** When no new applications are made (because everyone is matched or ran out of choices), the tentative matches become **Final**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this algorithm to pair up Medical Residents with Hospitals."
