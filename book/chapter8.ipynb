    "Imagine you are trying to build a railway connecting City A to City B. You need to buy land in **Segment 1** AND **Segment 2**.\n",
    "* If you get **both**, you make \\$1,000,000 profit.\n",
    "* If you get **only one**, you make \\$0 profit (a half-built railway is useless).\n",

    "## The Danger: Selling Items Separately\n",
    "In a \"Simultaneous Ascending Auction,\" Segment 1 and Segment 2 are sold in separate auction rooms at the same time.\n",
    "1.  You bid on both. You are winning both at \\$100k each. Great!\n",
    "2.  Suddenly, a competitor bids \\$900k for Segment 1.\n",
    "3.  **The Trap:**\n",
    "    * You can't beat \\$900k (Total cost would be \\$1M, leaving zero profit).\n",
    "    * So you stop bidding on Segment 1.\n",
    "    * **BUT:** You are still the high bidder on Segment 2 for \\$100k.\n",
    "    * **Result:** You lose Segment 1, win Segment 2. You pay \\$100k for a piece of land you can't use. **You lose \\$100k.**\n",

    "This fear causes bidders to be conservative, leading to inefficient markets. Let's simulate this \"train wreck\" scenario."

    "* The auctioneer acts as a computer, checking if your \\$100 package bid beats the sum of the individual bids (\\$70 + \\$20 = \\$90).\n",
