    "# Chapter 14: Smooth Games - The Universal Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for Traffic Games with linear costs, the Price of Anarchy is exactly $\\frac{5}{2}$ (2.5).\n",
    "But what if the game is slightly different? Or what if players aren't perfectly rational?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"Smoothness\" Framework\n",
    "Instead of analyzing games one by one, we define a property called **$(\\lambda, \\mu)$-Smoothness**.\n",
    "A game is smooth if, for any two outcomes $s$ (current) and $s^*$ (optimal), the costs satisfy:\n",
    "$$\\sum \\text{Cost}_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}) \\le \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Cost}(s^*) + \\mu \\cdot \\text{Cost}(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Robust PoA Theorem:**\n",
    "If a game is $(\\lambda, \\mu)$-smooth, then the Price of Anarchy is always:\n",
    "$$\\text{PoA} \\le \\frac{\\lambda}{1 - \\mu}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this \"Robust\"?**\n",
    "This bound holds **everywhere**:\n",
    "1.  **Pure Nash Equilibria** (Standard).\n",
    "2.  **Mixed Nash Equilibria** (Randomized strategies).\n",
    "3.  **No-Regret Learning** (Outcomes from learning algorithms like in Chapter 17).\n",
    "4.  **Coarse Correlated Equilibria**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: Affine Routing\n",
    "Traffic games with linear costs (Affine) are proven to be $(\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$-smooth.\n",
    "Let's plug that into the formula:\n",
    "$$\\text{PoA} \\le \\frac{5/3}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{5/3}{2/3} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This recovers the exact result we found in Chapter 12, but now we know it applies even if players are \"learning\" over time!"
